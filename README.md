# hospitalmanagementsystem

#The Hospital Management System is built using Python, HTML, CSS, and Flask to streamline hospital operations. Key functionalities include:

Front Desk Operator: Manages patient registration, appointments, test/treatment scheduling, admissions, and discharges with real-time feedback.
Database Administrator: Handles user (staff and doctor) management and system administration.
Data Entry Operator: Updates test results, treatment details, and medications.
Doctor: Prescribes treatments, tests, medications, views patient histories, manages appointments, and receives weekly health reports.
The system employs SQL for data handling, robust validation, and role-based access for efficient hospital management.
